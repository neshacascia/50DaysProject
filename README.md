# 50DaysProject
For the course of 50 days, I will be building a mini project utilizing HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.

This space is dedicated to building mini projects utilizing HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript over the course of 50 days. Inspiration from Brad Traversy. I am going to keep track of each challenge and in the future, I plan on revisiting to see how I can review and refactor my code to be more clean and efficient.
